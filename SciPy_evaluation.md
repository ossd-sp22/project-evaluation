## Finding info about contributing on the website.

In the following section you should only enter the information that you
found on the project website. Some of the answers will be impossible to find, others
may be very hard to find. Do not _google_ for answers.

__Project website:__

https://scipy.org/ 

__What is the purpose of the project:__

A python package for scientifically-oriented programming tasks. According to their User Guide, “SciPy is a collection of mathematical algorithms and convenience functions built on the NumPy extension of Python. It adds significant power to the interactive Python session by providing the user with high-level commands and classes for manipulating and visualizing data.”

__How easy was it to find information about contributing on the website?__
There is a link that leads to a contributing page in the footer of the home page of SciPy. https://scipy.org/contribute/

__Contributing instructions:__

SciPy has a developer guide that is quite handy and thorough, linked here: https://scipy.github.io/devdocs/dev/index.html

__URL for the code repository:__
The code repository was a little difficult to find but we found it hidden a few pages into the developer guide

https://github.com/scipy/scipy

__Bug/Issue tracker link:__
SciPy uses the Github Issue tracker, and it’s quite active! https://github.com/scipy/scipy/issues 

__Mailing list:__
The mailing list can be found in the contribute to SciPy page.
https://mail.python.org/mailman3/lists/scipy-dev.python.org/


__Chat channel:__
There doesn’t seem to be a chat channel - the mailing list and GitHub are their “preferred channels (open source is open by nature).”

__Other communication channels:__
Their mailing list, from which you can get details for their biweekly community calls and their GitHub.

https://github.com/scipy/scipy/issues/15633



- __are there issues marked "good for newbies", "beginner" or some other indicators that imply that they are good for beginner contributors:__
Yes, the example from the good discussion question is marked as a “good first issue”.
    - __how many of such issues are there?__
    Approximately 2-3 issues a month like this 
    - __look at a few of them, do they look beginner friendly?__ 
Many of them deal with documentation issues so that makes them quite accessible. 


- __are there issues marked "documentation" or some other indicators that imply that they are documentation (user or developer specific):__
Yes, many are! 

    - __how many of such issues are there?__
There are 507 closed issues and 112 open issues marked “documentation”
    
    - __look at a few of them, do you think you could submit a fix?__ 
I think we could definitely help with some of the documentation-related ones, but the others command a more technical level of insight that we’re uncertain about being able to provide.

## Summary assessment
__How friendly is this project for beginner contributors?__

Other than documentation aspects, a lot of recent work appears to have been highly technical. It seems like a lot of discussion is done by the same core group of developers. 

__Do the maintainers respond helpfully to questions in issues?__

A lot of the times the maintainers simply merge issues with other ones to mark them as duplicates with no comment. But other than when that happens, they’re usually quite welcoming and even encourage those who raised the issue to submit a pull request.

__Are people friendly in the issues, discussion forum, and chat (for example, IRC or Slack)?__

We couldn’t find a chat per se and the only way to find out would be to attend one of the “biweekly community calls.”


__Do pull requests get reviewed?__

Yes.


__Do maintainers thank people for their contributions?__

Yes, many issues that get resolved have a note of acknowledgement and thanks from the maintainers.
