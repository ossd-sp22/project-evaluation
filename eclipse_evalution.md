## Summary assesment
__How friendly is this project for beginner contributors?__ It is not very friendly for beginners, especially if someone wants to contribute to the code. Eclipse uses their own Git system which is a lot more confusing and less appealing than GitHub. 


__Do the maintainers respond helpfully to questions in issues?__ The maintainers seem active, responding to some questions within one to two hours, but at the same time most questions are ignored and got no responce at all. 


__Are people friendly in the issues, discussion forum, and chat (for example, IRC or Slack)?__ They are very straight forward which is really effective



__Do pull requests get reviewed?__ Yes they all do



__Do maintainers thank people for their contributions?__ I haven't seen any. But I guess most problems are solved by the maintainers themselves.
