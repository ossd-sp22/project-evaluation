## Finding info about contributing on the website.

In the following section you should only enter the information that you
found on the project website. Some of the answers will be impossible to find, others
may be very hard to find. Do not _google_ for answers.

__Project website:__ [Website](https://farm.bot/)


__What is the purpose of the project:__ 
FarmBot is a CNC farming project offering a drag and drop interface for users to design a farm layout and hardware to set up a small robotic farm. It markets to families that want to grow food in their backyards and schools that want to inspire the next generation of farmers, engineers, plant scientists, and coders.

__How easy was it to find information about contributing on the website?__ 
It was easy to find information on contributing. There is an "Open Source" tab in the menu and from there there are links to a playlist walking through the software features, software documentation, developer documentation, and the github repository. However, there are no specific "get started with contributing" articles, simply links to resources.

## Summary assesment
__How friendly is this project for beginner contributors?__
If one can get past the set up process and the lack of contributing instructions, there are some good first issues to look into. However, the lack of support, broken contributions page, and lack of code of conduct make it quite inaccessible to beginners.


__Do the maintainers respond helpfully to questions in issues?__
Yes, they are helpful and mostly friendly to people asking questions in issues.


__Are people friendly in the issues, discussion forum, and chat (for example, IRC or Slack)?__
Yes, people are friendly and the community seems supportive and collaborative.



__Do pull requests get reviewed?__
No, maintainers merge pull requests without a review.


__Do maintainers thank people for their contributions?__
Most of the contributions come from people within the team, in which case people are not thanked. However, they thank people that come from outside the organization.
