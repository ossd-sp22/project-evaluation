__What is the purpose of the project:__ Zulip is a software that combines real time chat with asynchronous communication, inspired by email's highly effective threading model. This software is the only app that handles both synchronous and asynchronous communication and organizes them in an efficient way. Rather than having to scroll through hundreds of missed messages, Zulip tackles this issue and allows users to catch up on missed messages and reply in context even to messages from hours or days before.
