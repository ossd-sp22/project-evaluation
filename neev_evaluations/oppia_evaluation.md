### Summary assesment
**How friendly is this project for beginner contributors?** We would contend that this project is not really an open source project. It is more like a repository of a lot of cool icons and a place where you can keep requesting icons or new features, and never really get a chance to contribute to the project. 
The developers actually have a lot of code in another (not mentioned) repository and that makes it difficult to actually look at the whole project. There is also a paid version of the project, which provides more icons and features - but that doesn’t make it “open.”

**Do the maintainers respond helpfully to questions in issues?** The maintainers are responsive and respectful to the requests.

**Are people friendly in the issues, discussion forum, and chat (for example, IRC or Slack)?** Yes, no instances of rudeness, discrimination or disrespectful behavior observed. 

**Do pull requests get reviewed?** Yes, they are reviewed. The maintainers also respond to why they are accepting or rejecting a particular pull request.

**Do maintainers thank people for their contributions?** Yes
