## Summary assesment

**How friendly is this project for beginner contributors?**

It can be challenging because it requires beginner contributors to learn the basics of cockroachDB and best if familiar with Go, which can require a lot of time and effort.

**Do the maintainers respond helpfully to questions in issues?**
Yes.

**Are people friendly in the issues, discussion forum, and chat (for example, IRC or Slack)?**
Yes.

**Do pull requests get reviewed?** Yes, they get A LOT of reviews. The last closed one had around 20 reviews. Sheesh a lot of pressure on the line...

**Do maintainers thank people for their contributions?**

It has a file that's called external Contributors - Hall of Fame. I absolutely love this name!!!
