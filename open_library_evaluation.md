## Finding info about contributing on the website.

In the following section you should only enter the information that you
found on the project website. Some of the answers will be impossible to find, others
may be very hard to find. Do not _google_ for answers.

__Project website:__ The link is [here](https://openlibrary.org/)!


__What is the purpose of the project:__ The project is "an open, editable library catalog, building towards a web page for every book ever published." It's follows a similar philosophy to the Cracking the Textbook videos we watched â€“ making information public and accessible to better inform the public.


__How easy was it to find information about contributing on the website?__ On the footer they have a section called 'Help' which includes places to report a bug or suggest an edit. It also includes an icon for their Github. That seems to be the extent of their information.


__Contributing instructions:__

__URL for the code repository:__ The repo can be found [here](https://github.com/internetarchive/openlibrary).

__Bug/Issue tracker link:__ There seems to be two main pages: their website links to a [suggesting edits](https://openlibrary.org/help/faq/editing) page and their Github has an issue tracker (although that is not explicitly linked in their website).

__Mailing list:__ The website advocates for three different mailing lists: [general](https://mail.archive.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/ol-discuss), [librarianship](https://mail.archive.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/ol-lib), and [tech](https://mail.archive.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/ol-tech).

__Chat channel:__ They have a [twitter](https://twitter.com/openlibrary) account which seems active and replies to people quickly.

__Other communication channels:__ They have a [contact](https://openlibrary.org/contact) page which gets relinked under `Report a Problem`.

    - __url for the last issue closed:__ [This](https://github.com/internetarchive/openlibrary/issues/6271) is their last issue.
    - __how many users discussed the issue:__ No one discussed the issue but the person who opened the pull request is different than the one who opened the issue. Lastly, the one who merged it was different than those two.
    - __when was the issue reported:__ The issue was reported four days ago.
    - __when was the issue closed:__ It was closed three days ago (one day turnover).

- __how active is the discussion on the issues:__  Although there is minimal discussion, all of the issues have mulitple tags include who the lead is, type, theme, and needs. Because of that, the issues feel very organized and managed. 

    - __example of a lot of good discussion:__ This [issue](https://github.com/internetarchive/openlibrary/issues/4474) has good discussion and good topics. It was tagged appropriately and welcomes all different contributions. 
    
    - __example of an issue that does not have much discussion:__ This [issue](https://github.com/internetarchive/openlibrary/issues/6249) doesn't have much discussion (or any) despite having a tag that says `Needs: Community Disucssion`.

    - __look at a few of them, do they look beginner friendly?__ They seem to be of medium difficulty if someone is not really well-versed in JS. A lot of the beginner issues are discussion based and so knowledge of the general functionality of libraries seems so more important to whether these issues can be considered a good first issue. Currently, they seem to be slightly on the harder side.



- __are there issues marked "documentation" or some other indicators that imply that they are documentation (user or developer specific):__ Yes!

    - __how many of such issues are there?__ There are [6](https://github.com/internetarchive/openlibrary/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22Affects%3A+Documentation%22) issues with the tag `Affects: Documentation`.
    
    - __look at a few of them, do you think you could submit a fix?__ 
I think I could submit a fix. Some of them are just about updating information or fixing broken links so while it might take some reading towards the structure of the project, it is certaintly doable.

## Summary assesment
__How friendly is this project for beginner contributors?__ I think this is a really amazing project for contributors in general but might be too difficult for beginners. Every issue is well-documented, assigned a lead, and tagged well so it might feel weird to intrude on what is clearly a really good workflow. The nature of the issues seem to be really specific and might require a really deep insight into their codebase (they do provide tutorials of it though). However, they are welcoming and so maybe work on documentation and user feedback would be where beginner contributors would feel the most welcome. 


__Do the maintainers respond helpfully to questions in issues?__
Some of the pull requests seem welcoming (they'll say something along the lines of "if someone from the community could look at this...") although it is unclear whether that community means other maintainers or general users. There was at least one issue where someone asked if they could be assigned it and there was no response: `"I'm beginner at openlibrary but i have enough development skills to work on enhancement/issue like this so if possible so assign this issue to me, i would like to work on it."`

In general, I think they seem friendly to a certain extent but their issues have Leads on them and so it might actually be hard to break that flow.

__Are people friendly in the issues, discussion forum, and chat (for example, IRC or Slack)?__
People seem friendly/bordering formal in the discussion forums. Sometimes there is no reply but most questions to get a very standard answer within twenty four hours. Behavior leans friendly and informative.


__Do pull requests get reviewed?__ A lot of the pull requests seem to be made by two main contributors: mekarpeles and jimchamp. They will often leave a comment or two that is typically a `lgtm` or `ty` but that is the extent of most of the project. 


__Do maintainers thank people for their contributions?__ They are thanked in the pull request they are creating but there is no separate page for it.
