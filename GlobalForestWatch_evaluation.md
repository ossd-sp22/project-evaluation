## **Summary assesment**

**How friendly is this project for beginner contributors?**

I think the project is indeed active. However, the strange thing is that there are very few open issues while pull requests and merging are constantly happening. I am wondering where does those merge request coming from if they are not from issues. Also, most of the commits were by one or two people - who is likely to be the project managers. Moreover, there are no active chat channels for this project. In this way, I doubt that this project is beginner contributors friendly.

**Do the maintainers respond helpfully to questions in issues?**

Yes, I think they responded helpfully if they respond, but sometimes they don’t respond. 

**Are people friendly in the issues, discussion forum, and chat (for example, IRC or Slack)?**

Yes. 

**Do pull requests get reviewed?**

Yes

**Do maintainers thank people for their contributions?**

They do not thank them explicitly.
