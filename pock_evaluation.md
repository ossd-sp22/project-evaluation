## **Summary assesment**

**How friendly is this project for beginner contributors?**

I think the project is very cool and the content itself is very friendly to contribute as the codes are well-documented. However, it seems like the discussion haven’t been very active in the past year. I research on the project founder’s linkedin page and it seems like he has a full time job and pock is just his side project. That is probabiliy why he did not maintained it well. However, one cool thing is that they profile a very clear guidelines and frameworks on how to build new widgets and add on their project. There are also repositories out there where people build customizable widgets on top of pock. It is just that they are not been included into the main repository. I believe that there are still ways to contribute to this project and build on to it despite the main repository being inactive.

**Do the maintainers respond helpfully to questions in issues?**

Unfortunately, some issues don’t get responded in the past year.

**Are people friendly in the issues, discussion forum, and chat (for example, IRC or Slack)?**

Peoople are friendly over these issues.

**Do pull requests get reviewed?**

Yes, they get reviewed.

**Do maintainers thank people for their contributions?**

I think the miantainers are thankful to these contributors.
