## Summary assessment
__How friendly is this project for beginner contributors?__ I would say this project is not very beginner-friendly. The difficulty level of coding was very high because the main coding language was Perl. Additionally, there were too many issues so it was very hard to select the one which beginners could focus on. 


__Do the maintainers respond helpfully to questions in issues?__ Yes, the maintainers responded very fast. It took them less than a week to reply.

__Are people friendly in the issues, discussion forum, and chat (for example, IRC or Slack)?__ There were not a lot of people invovled in the discussion on Github. However, this project did provide a slack channel for developers to communicate.


__Do pull requests get reviewed?__ Yes. 



__Do maintainers thank people for their contributions?__ Yes.
