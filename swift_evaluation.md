## Summary assessment
__How friendly is this project for beginner contributors?__
In our opinion, the project is not that friendly for beginner contributors. This is because the issues are held in a separate database, and have no tags to help beginners gravitate towards easier issues.

__Do the maintainers respond helpfully to questions in issues?__
Yes, the maintainers seem to be very active in the discussions regarding specific issues. They also regularly update the discussion on what still remains an issue and what is completed. 

__Are people friendly in the issues, discussion forum, and chat (for example, IRC or Slack)?__
People are professional and straight to the point in the issues, but very friendly in the discussion forum and chat.


__Do pull requests get reviewed?__
Yes, [this](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/41506) is a good example of pull requests getting reviewed. A conversation occurs under the pull request between the author and a project maintainer.


__Do maintainers thank people for their contributions?__
Yes! [This](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-15166?filter=-9) issue is a good example of this, where a maintainer thanks a person for their contribution and the issue gets turned into a pull request that shortly gets merged into the codebase.
