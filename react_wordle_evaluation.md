## Finding info about contributing on the website.

In the following section you should only enter the information that you
found on the project website. Some of the answers will be impossible to find, others
may be very hard to find. Do not _google_ for answers.

__Project website:__ This is their [website](https://reactle.vercel.app/).


__What is the purpose of the project:__ The project is an open source version of the NYT game [Wordle](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html). It then allows for variation and themes of the game.


__How easy was it to find information about contributing on the website?__  It's not that easy as the only place to find any information is in their link saying that their game is open source and a link to the code.


__Contributing instructions:__ There is only the link to the code, found in the popup at [this](https://reactle.vercel.app) website.

__URL for the code repository:__ The code can be found [here](insert link here).

__Bug/Issue tracker link:__ They do not have an issue tracker on their main website (only through project repo).

__Mailing list:__ They do not have a mailing list on their main website (only through project repo).

__Chat channel:__ They do not have a chat channel on their main website (only through project repo).

__Other communication channels:__ They don't have other forms of communcation. Their website is a game and while you are allowed to share your score, that is the extent of the 'communication' available.

## Finding info at the project repository and bug/issue tracker.

__License:__ They have the [MIT License](https://github.com/cwackerfuss/react-wordle/blob/main/LICENSE)

__Is it [OSI approved](https://opensource.org/licenses/alphabetical) license:__  Yes. 

__Programming Language:__ The project is mainly in Typescript (96.8%). The other components are negligible (1.6% CSS, 1.65 Other). 

__URL for contributing instructions:__ Their instructions seem to lie just within their [README](https://github.com/cwackerfuss/react-wordle). It's answered as part of their FAQ section or as a single comment in other sections. They lack a clear `Contributing.md` file though. 

__Are the contributing instructions clear?__ Considering their lack of a `Contributing.md` file, the instructions are comparatively clear. It is easy to figure out how to run the project, how variations can be applied, and how it can be submitted to the project (via pull requests). It even gives instructions on usage tracking. However, this doesn't seem marketed towards contributors and while contributions are welcome, they aren't necessarily encouraged.


__URL for code of conduct / community norms / community guildelines:__ Their code of conduct can be found[here](https://github.com/cwackerfuss/react-wordle/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

__URL for instructions for users to download and install the package:__ The [README](https://github.com/cwackerfuss/react-wordle) contains information on how to download it, locally and through docker.


__Are these instructions clear? Do you think they would be easy to follow?__ 
If people have previously used JS or Docker, they would be easy to follow as it seems that the package download is relatively small. However, it does seem to require some knowledge of deployment through that. It might be hard for someone who has never worked with/is unfamiliar with tech. 

__Number of contributors:__ There are [63](https://github.com/cwackerfuss/react-wordle/graphs/contributors) contributors.

    - __url for the last issue closed:__ The [last issue closed](https://github.com/cwackerfuss/react-wordle/issues/307) was closed roughly five days ago.
    - __how many users discussed the issue:__ Two different people beyond the original user (three in total) discussed the issue.

- __how active is the discussion on the issues:__ 

    - __example of a lot of good discussion:__ This one [issue](https://github.com/cwackerfuss/react-wordle/issues/120) has over 100 comments, most for different people.
    
    - __example of an issue that does not have much discussion:__ This [issue](https://github.com/cwackerfuss/react-wordle/issues/302) lacks discussion although there are two draft pull requests associated with it.



- __are there issues marked "good for newbies", "beginner" or some other indicators that imply that they are good for beginner contributors:__ 

    - __how many of such issues are there?__ 0 issues.
    
    - __look at a few of them, do they look beginner friendly?__ Since the project itself is word-based, one of the issues encourages thematic word-games which could be beginner friendly (theoretically: just change the database the words are in). However, the features/bugs of the projects do seem very difficult without prior knowledge about Typescript/website deployment.


- __are there issues marked "documentation" or some other indicators that imply that they are documentation (user or developer specific):__ 

    - __how many of such issues are there?__ 0 issues
    
    - __look at a few of them, do you think you could submit a fix?__ 
While there are no issues, we could easily add issues for documentation that we would then work on. For example, we could easily add and create a `contributing.md` document.

## Summary assesment
__How friendly is this project for beginner contributors?__ I think the project is friendly in terms of how it goes about welcoming contributions. The nature of the contribution does not require siginificant technical skills because it feels marketted towards non-CS people. As such, it's friendly in that a lot of pull requests are not towards the format/structure of the code but applications of it instead (similar to adding Firefox add-ons – the nature of how an add-on is changed but the types of add-ons are). I think that this project would also be open to better documentation and the people do seem friendly enough to welcome those changes too. Because the project seems relatively small, I think it is welcoming to others.


__Do the maintainers respond helpfully to questions in issues?__
Maintainers do seem helpful in responding to messages, either in suggesting other resources to look at or certain behaviors of the app. Other contributors also seem to answer questions in the issues as well.


__Are people friendly in the issues, discussion forum, and chat (for example, IRC or Slack)?__
People are friendly in the issues or at least courtesy enough to answer and link references when asked. However, there seems to be no external chat past the issues page which is not a great reflection of this project. 

__Do pull requests get reviewed?__
Pull requests do get reviewed and the comments there do seem very appreciative and friendly. When they get merged, people get thanked and feedback doesn't seem very nitpicky based. This could be because a lot of the pull requests stand independent of other parts of the codebase. 


__Do maintainers thank people for their contributions?__
They are thanked in the pull request, but not in any external document.
