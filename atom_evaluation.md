## Finding info about contributing on the website.

In the following section you should only enter the information that you
found on the project website. Some of the answers will be impossible to find, others
may be very hard to find. Do not _google_ for answers.

__Project website:__ The project website is https://atom.io/.


__What is the purpose of the project:__ Branded as a "hackable text editor for the 21st century", Atom prides itself on the vast customization and ease of access it has. It allows users to download from thousand of packages, live collaborations, and easy GitHub integration.


__How easy was it to find information about contributing on the website?__ It was the last section on the front page so relatively easy. In addition, there was a [link](https://github.com/atom/atom) to the repository on the website. The link then leads to the repository which includes more specific details on how to contribute.

__Contributing instructions:__ There are minimal instructions on the website detailing how to contribute, the website just points to the repository.

__URL for the code repository:__ The code repository is found [here](https://github.com/atom/atom)!

__Bug/Issue tracker link:__ They do not link to the bug/issue tracker on their website but instead just link to the code repository which contains that information.

__Mailing list:__ No mailing list is found, it seems like they prefer the chat channel route as they provide many links to their GitHub repository's [discussion page](https://github.com/atom/atom/discussions).

__Chat channel:__ They have a [Discussion board](https://github.com/atom/atom/discussions) open on GitHub which on the website is found in two places: their navigation bar and the bottom of the front page. Given that Atom was created by GitHub, it makes sense that they are using the main features of it as well.

__Other communication channels:__ They do have a [Twitter](https://twitter.com/atomeditor) ðŸ•Š however they have not posted since 2019.
They also have a blog on the [website](https://blog.atom.io/) which also has not posted since 2019. Lastly, you can [contact](https://atom.io/contact) them via email.

__License:__ They have a [MIT license](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/master/LICENSE.md) in relation to their project. They also described their [image usages](https://github.com/logos) under the licensed section.

__Is it [OSI approved](https://opensource.org/licenses/alphabetical) license:__ [Yes!](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT) Yay!

__Programming Language:__ Based on the meta data from the repository the project is mostly in Javascript, here are the breakdowns:

- JavaScript: 88.3%
- Less: 8.7%
- CoffeeScript: 2.8%
- Shell: 0.2%
- Batchfile: 0.0%
- Dockerfile: 0.0%

__URL for contributing instructions:__ Here is the link to their [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).

__Are the contributing instructions clear?__ The contributing document is very clear and well laid out including a table of contents and many helpful links to the resources cited in the contributing document. The document provides instructions to prepare before contributing, what kinds of contributions can be made, a style-guide and instructions for making pull requests.


__URL for code of conduct / community norms / community guildelines:__ Here is the link to their [CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

__URL for instructions for users to download and install the package:__ Here is the link to the [README.md](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/master/README.md) which contains the instructions for installation. They also created a Youtube [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U5POoGSrtGg) on how to work with Atom.


__Are these instructions clear? Do you think they would be easy to follow?__ The instructions on the repository are fairly clear but a bit confusing when deciding which file to download as the [link](https://github.com/atom/atom/releases/tag/v1.59.0) brings you to a page that has many different "Assets" and you have to know which one is right for you and your system. The download option on the [Atom website](https://atom.io/) is much easier to follow as it downloads the correct file for you. 


__Number of contributors:__ According to the [list](https://github.com/atom/atom/graphs/contributors), there are 489 contributors with the lead contributor, [Kevin Sawicki](https://github.com/kevinsawicki) having over 8500 commits.
