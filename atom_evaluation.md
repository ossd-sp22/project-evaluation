## Finding info about contributing on the website.

In the following section you should only enter the information that you
found on the project website. Some of the answers will be impossible to find, others
may be very hard to find. Do not _google_ for answers.

__Project website:__ The project website is https://atom.io/.


__What is the purpose of the project:__ Branded as a "hackable text editor for the 21st century", Atom prides itself on the vast customization and ease of access it has. It allows users to download from thousand of packages, live collaborations, and easy GitHub integration.


__How easy was it to find information about contributing on the website?__ It was the last section on the front page so relatively easy. In addition, there was a [link](https://github.com/atom/atom) to the repository on the website. The link then leads to the repository which includes more specific details on how to contribute.

__Contributing instructions:__ There are minimal instructions on the website detailing how to contribute, the website just points to the repository.

__URL for the code repository:__ The code repository is found [here](https://github.com/atom/atom)!

__Bug/Issue tracker link:__ They do not link to the bug/issue tracker on their website but instead just link to the code repository which contains that information.

__Mailing list:__ No mailing list is found, it seems like they prefer the chat channel route as they provide many links to their GitHub repository's [discussion page](https://github.com/atom/atom/discussions).

__Chat channel:__ They have a [Discussion board](https://github.com/atom/atom/discussions) open on GitHub which on the website is found in two places: their navigation bar and the bottom of the front page. Given that Atom was created by GitHub, it makes sense that they are using the main features of it as well.

__Other communication channels:__ They do have a [Twitter](https://twitter.com/atomeditor) ðŸ•Š however they have not posted since 2019.
They also have a blog on the [website](https://blog.atom.io/) which also has not posted since 2019. Lastly, you can [contact](https://atom.io/contact) them via email.

## Finding info at the project repository and bug/issue tracker.

__License:__ They have a [MIT license](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/master/LICENSE.md) in relation to their project. They also described their [image usages](https://github.com/logos) under the licensed section.

__Is it [OSI approved](https://opensource.org/licenses/alphabetical) license:__ [Yes!](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT) Yay!

__Programming Language:__ Based on the meta data from the repository the project is mostly in Javascript, here are the breakdowns:

- JavaScript: 88.3%
- Less: 8.7%
- CoffeeScript: 2.8%
- Shell: 0.2%
- Batchfile: 0.0%
- Dockerfile: 0.0%

__URL for contributing instructions:__ Here is the link to their [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).

__Are the contributing instructions clear?__ The contributing document is very clear and well laid out including a table of contents and many helpful links to the resources cited in the contributing document. The document provides instructions to prepare before contributing, what kinds of contributions can be made, a style-guide and instructions for making pull requests.


__URL for code of conduct / community norms / community guildelines:__ Here is the link to their [CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

__URL for instructions for users to download and install the package:__ Here is the link to the [README.md](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/master/README.md) which contains the instructions for installation. They also created a Youtube [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U5POoGSrtGg) on how to work with Atom.


__Are these instructions clear? Do you think they would be easy to follow?__ The instructions on the repository are fairly clear but a bit confusing when deciding which file to download as the [link](https://github.com/atom/atom/releases/tag/v1.59.0) brings you to a page that has many different "Assets" and you have to know which one is right for you and your system. The download option on the [Atom website](https://atom.io/) is much easier to follow as it downloads the correct file for you.


__Number of contributors:__ According to the [list](https://github.com/atom/atom/graphs/contributors), there are 489 contributors with the lead contributor, [Kevin Sawicki](https://github.com/kevinsawicki) having over 8500 commits.

- __how active is the discussion on the issues:__ Usually there is 1-3 comments per closed issue so not a ton of discussion.

    - __example of a lot of good discussion:__ Here is a [link to issue](https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/2654) that has good discussion.

    - __example of an issue that does not have much discussion:__ Here is a [link to issue](https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/23529) of an issue that lacks discussion.



- __are there issues marked "good for newbies", "beginner" or some other indicators that imply that they are good for beginner contributors:__

    - __how many of such issues are there?__ Yes they link to them in the CONTRIBUTING.md, they are [here](https://github.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Abeginner+label%3Ahelp-wanted+user%3Aatom+sort%3Acomments-desc). Although all the beginner level issues are at least 6 years old...

    - __look at a few of them, do they look beginner friendly?__ It's hard to tell because they are somewhat vague. They are generally just functions that they would like to include in the App but it's not clear how hard the tasks would be. I think this fact would lend to the argument that the issues are not that beginner friendly.

- __are there issues marked "documentation" or some other indicators that imply that they are documentation (user or developer specific):__ Yes

    - __how many of such issues are there?__ 2

    - __look at a few of them, do you think you could submit a fix?__ Yes I could, although these issues are more so calls for larger documents such as manuals and coding convention documents to be created.

## Summary assesment
__How friendly is this project for beginner contributors?__

This project isn't that friendly for beginner contributors. While they are welcoming and do have really comprehensive instructions on how to contribute, code contributions at least seem to be between two main maintainers with not much discussion between each pull request. They have over 750 issues yet most of them are not tagged (with none of them being tagged `beginner-friendly`) which might make joining feel really intimidating at first.

Also the nature of the issues might be beyond the scope of what we are expected to know. While some issues follow their expected format of Steps to Reproduce, Stack Trace, and Non-Core Packages, others just mention a given bug with no other description. As such, it's hard to assume who, if anyone, is working a given pull request or even the nature of the pull request.

__Do the maintainers respond helpfully to questions in issues?__

A lot of the issues currently opened to not have any discussion involved at all. Issues that do ask questions sometimes get comments from other non-contributors that support the issue. There is only one instance [here](https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/23593) out of the first page of issue where maintainers respond to an issue.

__Are people friendly in the issues, discussion forum, and chat (for example, IRC or Slack)?__

While there is not much discussion, the discussion that is there is very direct and straightforward. In most cases, it's simply either an agreement with an issue or a suggestion for something else. On their discussion page, the community does seem welcoming. In this [post](https://github.com/atom/atom/discussions/22847) on the status of Atom, there is evidence that there is still a strong sense of community.


__Do pull requests get reviewed?__

Pull request typically do not get reviewed â€“ they either get merged within a few hours or are closed. Even when they get closed by the maintainers, there are no comments that explain why the PR gets rejected.


__Do maintainers thank people for their contributions?__

With two thumbs up and a confetti, it's the very first line of the [contributing](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) page. However, it is hard to find, if it exists, a list of all the contributors past the default one Github has.
