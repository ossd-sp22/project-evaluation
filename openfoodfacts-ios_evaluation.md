## Summary assesment
__How friendly is this project for beginner contributors?__
This project has a good contributing guide and makes it easy for people to install and familiarize themselves with the codebase. However, while OpenFoodFacts seems to have a very active community in general, the repository for the iOS app is not the most active. A lot of recent contributions have come from bots or from teolemon, one of the maintainers.

__Do the maintainers respond helpfully to questions in issues?__
Maintainers are helpful in issues, but it seems to be mostly spearheaded by one maintainer and I see only two consistent contributors in the most recent commits, aside from the bots.


__Are people friendly in the issues, discussion forum, and chat (for example, IRC or Slack)?__
People are very friendly in issues and slack. While the slack is very active, the wiki seems a bit out of date (the last year in the "Upcoming Events" link is 2017).

__Do pull requests get reviewed?__
Yes, reviews are requested and maintainers provide feedback for issues within the code ([example](https://github.com/openfoodfacts/openfoodfacts-ios/pull/697)).


__Do maintainers thank people for their contributions?__
Yes! They do.
