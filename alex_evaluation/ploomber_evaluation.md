  - **when was the issue reported:** 7 days ago
  - **when was the issue closed:** 7 days ago

- **how active is the discussion on the issues:** Pretty active overall. Looks like majority of closed issues have 3-7 comments on them and some open issues also have some comments on them.

  - **example of a lot of good discussion:** https://github.com/ploomber/ploomber/issues/618

  - **example of an issue that does not have much discussion:**  https://github.com/ploomber/ploomber/issues/613

- **are there issues marked "good for newbies", "beginner" or some other indicators that imply that they are good for beginner contributors:** Yes, itâ€™s called good first issue

  - **how many of such issues are there?** 34 open issues tagged "good first issue"

  - **look at a few of them, do they look beginner friendly?** There are numerous open issues and some of them have comments further describing the issue. A few of the issues seem pretty understandable but all the issues in general clearly require a deeper understanding of how Ploomber works which makes it a bit difficult to start thinking how you would implement a solution for the issues. Perhaps if I were to look deeper at the currently code and use Ploomber a bit, they would make a lot more sense.

- **are there issues marked "documentation" or some other indicators that imply that they are documentation (user or developer specific):** Yes

  - **how many of such issues are there?** 8

  - **look at a few of them, do you think you could submit a fix?** Some of them seem like they would be simple if I was more knowledgeable on how Ploomber worked.

## Summary assesment

**How friendly is this project for beginner contributors?**
The project seems to welcome beginner contributors as there are many issues tagged "good first issue" and they also seem to have a welcoming tone in their docs when it comes to beginners, encouraging people to reach out for questions and join slack. The slack channel itself has area to learn more about data science. However, Ploomber itself seems like a bit of a technical product built ontop of juptyer notebook, so while it might make sense what their features do to someone like me who has used jupyter before, it's still hard to understand how it works from a high-level.


**Do the maintainers respond helpfully to questions in issues?** 
 Yes. The comments all seem to be friendly and helpful and there are a decent number of issues with comments.

**Are people friendly in the issues, discussion forum, and chat (for example, IRC or Slack)?**
Yes people are friendly in the slack channel, and encourage people to introduce themselves / ask them anything.

**Do pull requests get reviewed?** Yes

**Do maintainers thank people for their contributions?** The maintainers seem to mostly just approve pull requests.
