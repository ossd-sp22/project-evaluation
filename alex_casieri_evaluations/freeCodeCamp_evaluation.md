## Finding info about contributing on the website.

In the following section you should only enter the information that you
found on the project website. Some of the answers will be impossible to find, others
may be very hard to find. Do not _google_ for answers.

__Project website:__
[FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/)

__What is the purpose of the project:__
FreeCodeCamp is a website that teaches beginner users how to code in a variety of different languages. 

__How easy was it to find information about contributing on the website?__
From the main site it is not easy to find information about contributing to the project. However, there is a link to the GitHub repository, from which you can access the CONTRIBUTING.md file, which contains another link to [this document](https://contribute.freecodecamp.org/#/), which has instructions on how to contribute. 

__Contributing instructions:__
The contributing site outlines three main ways for users to contribute. They can 1) contribute to the curriculum, 2) contribute by helping translate freeCodeCamp to other languages, and 3) contribute to the codebase, which can be done by cloning the repository locally, which has some further requirements. 

These include installing Node.js on your machine with version 16.0 or greater, installing npm with version 8.0 or greater, and installing MongoDB community server with version 4.2.0 or greater. Then, follow the same instructions as you would normally do to contribute: fork the repo, clone locally, make changes, and submit pull request.
