__How easy was it to find information about contributing on the website?__
Very easy. On the home page, under a section called "Documentation", there is a link that says "Contributing to pandas".

__Bug/Issue tracker link:__
In the GitHub repository, there is a section for issues that is clearly shown at the top of the repo. 

__Mailing list:__
The pandas mailing list was extremely diffifult to find. I did not expect to find it under the documentation part of the site, but if you click on "documentation", there is a very small link all the way to the right of the page indicating the [mailing list](https://groups.google.com/g/pydata). 

__Chat channel:__
There is no "chat" channel on the pandas site. 

__Other communication channels:__
This site does have a [Blog](https://pandas.pydata.org/community/blog/) that is very easy to find from the home page.
