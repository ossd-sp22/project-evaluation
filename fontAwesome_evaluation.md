# Finding info about contributing on the website.

### In the following section you should only enter the information that you found on the project website. Some of the answers will be impossible to find, others may be very hard to find. Do not google for answers.

**Project website:** https://fontawesome.com/

**What is the purpose of the project:** FontAwesome is an icon library and toolkit created for designers, developers, and content creators. You can create your kit and use the icons in the kit on your website, programs, etc. However, the README document and the website have little to no content about what the project is and where it can be used. They use a lot of their own vocabulary that they don’t explain - their FAQs and other “help” information is only about HOW to use the project. 

How easy was it to find information about contributing on the website? Very easy. At the bottom of the page, the project states that it is one of the top open source projects on Github and links to the repository.  

**Contributing instructions:**
(https://github.com/FortAwesome/Font-Awesome/blob/6.x/CONTRIBUTING.md)
The contributing document dictates that you can only request a new icon, feature or report a bug. 
You cannot contribute by creating new icons that users are requesting - which casts doubt on how “open” this project really is.
