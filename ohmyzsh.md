**URL for contributing instructions:**

https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md

**Are the contributing instructions clear?**

Yes, it contains information about how to report issues, make pull requests, style guides and format etc. Also has some personality to it which is fun (eg. One of the headers is “Use the Search, Luke” which is a Star Wars reference).

**URL for code of conduct / community norms / community guildelines:**

**URL for instructions for users to download and install the package:**

https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/blob/master/README.md 

**Are these instructions clear? Do you think they would be easy to follow?**

The basic installation instructions seem easy to follow as they are presented in a table format with commands and are easily copy pastable into the terminal. However, the enabling plugins section was slightly harder to follow. While the enabling plugins section has all the necessary information, there could be more documentation containing things like images of what the .zshrc file looks like for example. A walkthrough of one of the plugins so that the user can visualize what it would look like could have also been helpful and could make users more willing to click on the link that shows all the other plugins.
