## Summary assesment
__How friendly is this project for beginner contributors?__

The project wasn’t that friendly to us because first, we are extremely new to (almost never heard of) PHP language, and second, there are too many folders and files with very complicated names that it’s very confusing for us to understand and learn what each folder/file does.


__Do the maintainers respond helpfully to questions in issues?__

We think the maintainers do a really good job with discussing the problem and suggesting possible solutions. For instance, look at this issue: https://github.com/openemr/openemr/issues/4868

One person asks a question about one line and another person answers the question with details, such as what is wrong and what could be done to solve it.
Also, they leave a note to contact them anytime when one finds any other issues, which is also very helpful.


__Are people friendly in the issues, discussion forum, and chat (for example, IRC or Slack)?__

People are friendly in the issues, discussion forum, and chat. However, some of the questions don’t get much attention and are ignored by the project teams, which I don’t think that it is a good sign. 

__Do pull requests get reviewed?__

Yes, most of them are reviewed quite rapidly.

__Do maintainers thank people for their contributions?__

The maintainers do not thank contributors explicitly. However, they are friendly so we assume that they are thankful.
