## Finding info about contributing on the website.

In the following section you should only enter the information that you
found on the project website. Some of the answers will be impossible to find, others
may be very hard to find. Do not _google_ for answers.

__Project website:__ [https://openmrs.org/](https://openmrs.org/)


__What is the purpose of the project:__ The purpose is to provide a software application that enables countries around the world to be able to maintain medical records.


__How easy was it to find information about contributing on the website?__ It was very easy to find where to get involved, however, the information within the content was very broad and provided barely any information other than to pick an issue and code. It did not even specify where to pick an issue.


__Contributing instructions:__ The website mentions various ways to get involved including design, mentoring, documentation, coding, planning, organizing, and public speaking. Although the Github page goes more in depth within each repo, there is a different CONTRIBUTING.md file that contains the steps on how to contribute. For instance, the openmrs-core repo instructs to first find a Jira ticket, code, ensure the tests pass, and commit the code.

__URL for the code repository:__ [https://github.com/openmrs/](https://github.com/openmrs/)

__Bug/Issue tracker link:__ [https://issues.openmrs.org/secure/Dashboard.jspa](https://issues.openmrs.org/secure/Dashboard.jspa)

__Mailing list:__ From what it appears, there is no traditional mailing list. However, within this [community page](https://openmrs.org/community/) contains different communication platforms that OpenMRS uses.


__Chat channel:__ It seems that the main chat channel for developers/contributors is [ID](https://id.openmrs.org/). However, there are three other channels as well for other purposes.

__Other communication channels:__
* [IRC Talk](https://wiki.openmrs.org/display/IRC/Home)
* [Talk](https://talk.openmrs.org/)
* [Atlas](https://atlas.openmrs.org/)

## Summary assessment
__How friendly is this project for beginner contributors?__ This project I would say is not friendly for beginners. Openmrs offers many opportunities to contribute to an open source project, however, the different tasks are not beginner friendly. The reason being is that there is not much instruction on how to contribute to the project. For instance, Openmrs uses the JIRA ticketing system for open contributions, but does not explain how to use JIRA and when users ask questions, maintainers are not very friendly. Perhaps for an experienced contributor or developer, this would be a good project, but not for beginners.


__Do the maintainers respond helpfully to questions in issues?__ Sometimes maintainers can be fairly helpful in responding to contributors questions, but there were several occasions where the maintainers had passive aggressive responses that was not helpful in anyway to contributors.


__Are people friendly in the issues, discussion forum, and chat (for example, IRC or Slack)?__ In general people are friendly, but it seems they do not maintain much patience when it comes to beginners or also in cases where a person is struggling to complete a task in a given time frame.



__Do pull requests get reviewed?__ Yes they are reviewed.



__Do maintainers thank people for their contributions?__ Sometimes contributors are thanked, but not always.
