## Finding info about contributing on the website.

In the following section you should only enter the information that you
found on the project website. Some of the answers will be impossible to find, others
may be very hard to find. Do not _google_ for answers.

**Project website:**

https://www.freecodecamp.org/

**What is the purpose of the project:**

Help people learn how to code for free by providing lessons and learning curriculum for numerous coding topics.

**How easy was it to find information about contributing on the website?**

They have a CONTRIBUTING.md file and it redirects to a website version of the docs. It looks cool but is a bit much to navigate. There are numerous ways to contribute though that aren't specifically related to coding, such as editing the curriculums and docs.

**Contributing instructions:**

A bit vague on whether you just make Pull Requests or not. Can answer questions on community forum though, give feedback on coding, and/or translate their resources into other languages as other ways to contribute.

## Summary assesment

**How friendly is this project for beginner contributors?**
While the project has no open "first time only" issues, the project overall seems friendly for beginners. The whole ethos of free code camp is to help make coding education more accessible to everyone. As such the product is geared more towards educating people via lessons and education. The nature of the product makes this project a lot more digestable since most of the contributions are simply editing curriculum.


**Do the maintainers respond helpfully to questions in issues?** 
 Yes. The maintainers reply quickly and also have helped settle arguments in the comments in a civil manner.

**Are people friendly in the issues, discussion forum, and chat (for example, IRC or Slack)?**
The people mostly seem friendly although there are also some people who have very strong opinons about how coding should be taught so the discussions can get a bit heated sometimes (one person accused another one of twisting their words once). 

**Do pull requests get reviewed?** Yes

**Do maintainers thank people for their contributions?** The maintainers seem to mostly just approve pull requests.
