__Project Name: Kate__

## Finding info about contributing on the website.

In the following section you should only enter the information that you
found on the project website. Some of the answers will be impossible to find, others
may be very hard to find. Do not _google_ for answers.

__Project website:__
[Kate Editor](https://kate-editor.org/)

__What is the purpose of the project:__
Kate is an open source text editor. 

__How easy was it to find information about contributing on the website?__
It was relatively hidden, under the "More" dropdown. This might make it more difficult to access than other projects. 

__Contributing instructions:__
The instructions were easy to find and pretty clear once the "Join Us" page is found. In order to contribute, one must go to the [GitLab Instance](invent.kde.org) and open a new merge request. 

__URL for the code repository:__
[Kate Repository](https://invent.kde.org/utilities/kate)

__Bug/Issue tracker link:__
In the Kate Code repository, there are sections named "Issues" and "BugZilla". The "Issues" tab mainly highlights different tasks to be completed, while the "BugZilla" tab lists bugs that have come up that need fixing or have been fixed. 

__Mailing list:__
The [Kate Mailing List](kwrite-devel@kde.org) was found in the "More" tab, under "Get Help".

__Chat channel:__
[Chat Channel](irc://irc.libera.chat/kate) was found directly below the mailing list.

__Other communication channels:__
There is a [Blog](https://kate-editor.org/post/) option on the homepage, that allows users to see past posts.

## Finding info at the project repository and bug/issue tracker.

__License:__ LGPL v2+ and MIT. Outlined in the README. Repo also includes
several other licenses, which is odd; there might be licensing issues for some
parts of the codebase.

__Is it [OSI approved](https://opensource.org/licenses/alphabetical) license:__
Yes.

__Programming Language:__ Mostly C++, with some C, a little bit in other
languages.

__URL for contributing instructions:__ The [Join Us!](https://opensource.org/licenses/alphabetica)
page and the [Contributing via GitLab Merge Requests](https://kate-editor.org/post/2020/2020-07-18-contributing-via-gitlab-merge-requests/).
There is no CONTRIBUTING.MD file anywhere.

__Are the contributing instructions clear?__ 
The instructions themselves are clear, but if you're new to the project, it
might be hard to find them.

__URL for code of conduct / community norms / community guildelines:__
[Code of Conduct](https://kde.org/code-of-conduct/). Notably, this is not found
anywhere in the repo, but instead on the KDE website.

__URL for instructions for users to download and install the package:__
The [Build it!](https://kate-editor.org/build-it/) tutorial. There's a link to
it in the repo.

__Are these instructions clear? Do you think they would be easy to follow?__
They're clear but complicated. If you're new to contributing to OSS projects,
or developing large projects in general, it might be a bit hard to follow.
That being said, following the instructions closely should be enough.

__Number of contributors:__ 98.

each of them list the link to their latest commit__:
