# project-evaluation-activity

In this activity you will evaluate an open source project.

You should be working with your assigned partner (or two). 

Create a new file in this repository and copy the template from the `project_evaluation.md` into it.
You should name the file by replacing the word "project" in the template by the name of the project you are looking at. 

Answer all the questions in the template based on the information on the project website and in the project repository (DO NOT use a search engine!!!).
