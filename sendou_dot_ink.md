A website providing several resources (primarily) to the competitive Splatoon 2 community including software which allows you to test different gear builds, a database where you can share and view others builds, and a system currently in the works which allows players to join a queue and get paired up against other teams to scrim.

## Summary assesment
__How friendly is this project for beginner contributors?__

Sendouc consistently contributes to the project, is incredibly quick to reply to questions, and appears encouraging to those who wish to contribute; that being said there aren't often contributors besides him, and as a result it'd be hard to say whether or not the project's current workflow would be well suited to a (relatively) larger amount of contributors. That being said, I feel the ease of communication and the generally welcoming development team would make it easier for a beginner to contribute.


__Do the maintainers respond helpfully to questions in issues?__

Yes! it seems the collaborators are friendly and respond in a timely manner.


__Are people friendly in the issues, discussion forum, and chat (for example, IRC or Slack)?__

Yes! Everyone appears to be respectful and generally helpful when a question is asked.


__Do pull requests get reviewed?__

Not often, but those not made by Sendou himself appear to be.


__Do maintainers thank people for their contributions?__

Yes! :)
