## Summary assessment
__How friendly is this project for beginner contributors?__ This project I would say is not friendly for beginners. They seem to be primarily looking for code contributions, but there are occasionally translation and database updates to be made. There is a document specifically for [Ideas for New Developers](https://github.com/smogon/pokemon-showdown/issues/2444) for pointers on where to begin.


__Do the maintainers respond helpfully to questions in issues?__ Yes! Everyone seems friendly.


__Are people friendly in the issues, discussion forum, and chat (for example, IRC or Slack)?__ Everyone seems friendly from the various issues, pull requests, and the Discord server that I took a glance at!



__Do pull requests get reviewed?__ Yes, they are reviewed.



__Do maintainers thank people for their contributions?__ Yes!
