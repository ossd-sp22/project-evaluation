## Summary assesment
__How friendly is this project for beginner contributors?__

This project is very friendly. There is a comprehensive guide detailing how to get started, and the developer chat is always there to help.


__Do the maintainers respond helpfully to questions in issues?__

We believe so. Many of the maintainers are very quick to reply, and we didn’t notice any hostile reactions from anyone when somebody asked for help.


__Are people friendly in the issues, discussion forum, and chat (for example, IRC or Slack)?__

Yes, there are always questions being asked and people will always help and try to answer those questions in a polite and friendly manner.


__Do pull requests get reviewed?__

They definitely do get reviewed. The fact that there were thousands of closed “patches” (they’re called patches but they essentially serve as pull requests) while there were only 6 open ones should show that they do get reviewed quickly. Additionally, the last closed patch was reviewed and closed just a day after it was created.

__Do maintainers thank people for their contributions?__

Maintainers get recognized for their contributions on the website. They list all the contributors and the number of contributions they made.
